# Introduction To GitHub

## What is GitHub?
- GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories.
- It lets you share, collaborate, and back up your projects.
- Think of Git as the engine, and GitHub as the garage where you store and share your cars (projects).

## Create a GitHub Profile (Step by Step)
1) Click this [link](https://github.com/)
2) Click Sign up.
3) Enter:
- Username (pick something professional).
- Email address (use a valid one).
- Password.
4) Verify the puzzle challenge (to confirm you’re human).
5) Choose Free plan (good for beginners).
6) Check your email for a verification link → Click to confirm.

## Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) - MUST DO
- 2FA adds an extra layer of security. You'll need your password and your phone to log in.
- You should be having a 2FA App in your phone, either Google or Windows Auntheticator App

1) Click your profile picture in the top-right corner of GitHub and select Settings.
2) In the left sidebar, click Password and authentication.
3) Click Set up two-factor authentication.
4) Choose Set up using an app (this is more reliable than SMS).
5) You will need an authenticator app on your phone. I recommend Authy or Google Authenticator. Download one if you don't have it.
6) On the GitHub screen, your authenticator app will show a QR code. Open your authenticator app, tap the "+" icon, and scan the QR code. The app will now generate a 6-digit code for GitHub.
7) Enter the code from your app into GitHub to confirm.
8) GitHub will give you recovery codes. DOWNLOAD THESE AND SAVE THEM SOMEWHERE VERY SAFE (like a password manager or a secure note). These are your only way back in if you lose your phone.
9) Complete the setup. You're now much more secure!
